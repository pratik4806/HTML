<!-- 
Q. why the index file name is index.html only??
-> we make the website using frontend(html css javascript)
backend using (let say asp.NET, MVC) and connect both using API
-> furhter we  require the domain(we have to buy that form i.e go daddy) and hosting(to host the website)
-> to know the hosting website which file to open as soon as the domain name is accessed, we name the first file name as index.html 
-->

<!-- 
we can make out custom tag also
ex. <pratik>this is a pratik tag</pratik>

but it will not be having any formatting just a plain text.
-->

<!--
 1. <!DOCTYPE html>
Purpose: Declares the document type and version of HTML being used.
Role: It tells the browser how to render the document.
Syntax: The <!DOCTYPE html> declaration is not an HTML element; it is a declaration that must appear at the very top of the document, before the <html> tag.
Details:
In modern web development, <!DOCTYPE html> is used to indicate that the document follows HTML5 standards.
It ensures the browser renders the page in standards mode rather than quirks mode, which helps avoid inconsistent rendering
 -->

<!-- 
 <html>
    Purpose: Represents the root element of an HTML document.
    Role: Encapsulates all the content of the HTML document.
    Syntax: The <html> tag must directly follow the <!DOCTYPE> declaration and should enclose all other HTML tags in the document.
    Attributes:
    Common attributes include lang (for setting the language of the document) and dir (for setting text direction).
    Example: <html lang="en"> specifies that the document is in English. 
-->

<!-- 

Aspect	<!DOCTYPE html>	<html>
Type	Declaration	HTML Element
Position	Top of the document, before any elements.	Root of the HTML document hierarchy.
Purpose	Specifies HTML version (e.g., HTML5).	Encapsulates document content.
Effect	Controls browser rendering mode.	Structures the content of the page.
In summary, <!DOCTYPE html> is a declaration for the browser, while <html> is the main container for the content of the webpage. Both are essential for creating a valid HTML document.
 -->

 <!--
 Q. why we add the alt attribute in img tag?
 -> if by any chance if the url of the image is broken down then it will be difficult for us to know where exactly the image was in our webpage. so to locate that we add an alternate text there.

 href=hyper reference
